Welcome to the RGUKT Ongole Campus Leave Management System repository!

This repository contains the website files for a leave management system developed by Hemanth, a student at RGUKT Ongole campus. The system is designed to streamline the process of requesting and approving leave for students and faculty at the university.

With this system, users can easily submit leave requests, view their leave history, and track the status of their requests. The system also includes an administrative panel for faculty members to review and approve leave requests.

We hope that this system will help make the leave process more efficient and convenient for everyone at RGUKT Ongole campus. Thank you for visiting and we hope you find the repository helpful!

And this is the working(website) of this files....
